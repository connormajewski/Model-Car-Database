# Model Car Database #
This is a Python application I am working on for management of a model car database.

I wrote the frontend for this program using the CustomTkinter library, found [here](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/).
I used sqlite3 for the backend, which included creating the database and running queries.
For file saving I used openpyxl and tkinter's filedialog module.

## Dependencies ##
The current prerelease for this project was bundled using PyInstaller on Windows 10.
All Python dependencies are included in the bundle, but can also be found in the requirements.txt file in the source repository.

## Installation ##
To install, navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/connormajewski/Model-Car-Database/releases/) tab and click on the most up to date release.
Download and extract the .zip to your computer and move the extracted folder to wherever you want it to go.
To run, click on main.exe, or create a shorcut to it somewhere on your system.

## Notes ##
This project is a work in progress. The current prerelease is a proof-of-concept for the idea. From here, I will need to improve and clean up what I have written, as well as add additional features. I plan on revising what I have so far and packaging it into a prerelease.
