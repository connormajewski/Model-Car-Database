# Model Car Database #
This is a Python application I am working on for management of a model car database.

I wrote the frontend for this program using the CustomTkinter library, found [here](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/).
I used sqlite3 for the backend, which included creating the database and running queries.
For file saving I used openpyxl and tkinter's filedialog module.
